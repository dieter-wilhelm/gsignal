\title{gsignal: Signal Processing}
\description{
I wanted to learn more about signal analysis, so I thought it would be useful to study
    the the Matlab/Octave signal package. Gsignal is my own R implementation of the Octave signal package.
    This allowed me to get a basic understanding of the algorithms and experiment in R.
