\title{Chebyshev window}
\usage{
chebwin(n, at = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Window length, specified as a positive integer.}

\item{at}{Stop-band attenuation in dB. Default: 100.}
}
\value{
Chebyshev window, returned as a vector. If you specify a one-point
  window \code{(n = 1)}, the value 1 is returned.
}
\description{
Return the filter coefficients of a Dolph-Chebyshev window.
}
\details{
The window is described in frequency domain by the expression:
\if{latex}{
  \deqn{W(k) = \frac{Cheb(m - 1, \beta \cdot cos(\pi \cdot k / m))}{Cheb(m -
  1, \beta)}}
}
\if{html}{\preformatted{
                Cheb(m - 1, Beta * cos(\pi * k / m))
         W(k) = ------------------------------------
                       Cheb(m - 1, Beta)
}}
with
\if{latex}{
  \deqn{\beta = cosh(1 / (m - 1) \cdot acosh(10^{(at / 20)})}
}
\if{html}{\preformatted{
  Beta = cosh(1 / (m - 1) * acosh(10^(at / 20))
}}
and and \eqn{Cheb(m, x)} denoting the \eqn{m}-th order Chebyshev polynomial
calculated at the point \eqn{x}.

Note that the denominator in W(k) above is not computed, and after the
inverse Fourier transform the window is scaled by making its maximum value
unitary.
